The objective of this workshop is to examine the elements involved in establishing and maintaining security for a network, and building an understanding and familiarity with their operation.
Device and network infrastructure security is examined with a focus on establishing a robust, stable, and secure network while protecting the data and processes that occur in the network.
The workshop also looks at the nature and structure of network attacks and the motivation that drives such online malicious activity. The types of tools that are used in modern attacks, who is behind them, and the impact they have are also discussed. The course further examines the actions and processes that can be used to identify, mitigate, and respond to such attacks. The role and impact of botnets will also be discussed in detail covering botnet operation, functionality, and control.
